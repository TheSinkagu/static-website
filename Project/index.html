        <h4>Longevity and Sillage</h4>
        <p>
          This amazing fragrance is known for lasting 8-12 hours in Longevity.
          And on top of the longevity being well above average. This fragrance
          leaves a very nice cinnamon roll/french toast type of scent trail.

        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <p>
          I REALLY LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE AND THINK YOU SHOULD TRY IT! I personally
          think that if you enjoy the smell of a nice fresh pan of cinnamon
          rolls than you will absolutely love this fragrance. Also if you like
          pancake or coffee another good fragrance that I reccommend is Followed
          by kerosene. It has this nice beautiful coffee opening with a monster
          SILLAGE and Longevity. I personally get 24 hours with that fragrance
          and easily a mile wide Sillage of deliciousness.
